4,Good phone but expensive,"I got this after using multiple Samsung and Google phones, all of which had their own issues. After using it for some time, here are my impressions with both good and not so good parts.<br><br>Good parts:<br><br>- The build quality is good, the phone feels great in hand and has some weight to it, unlike phones like Google Pixel 5 which feels like a cheap toy. You can also watch video by JerryRigEverything, this phone does not bend easily with very strong frame.<br><br>- The display quality is good, especially pixel density, which is 525 ppi. I have tried phones with lower pixel density such as Pixel 5, they're ok if your vision is good but if you have nearsightedness and have to use phone close to your face you will easily notice individual pixels on phones with lower pixel density. On OnePlus 9 Pro you will not have this issue.<br><br>- The OS is better than on Samsung phones. It is close to stock, there is no bloat like on Samsung phones, many apps can be uninstalled except apps like Gallery or Netflix. It is close to Pixel phone OS, except the launcher on OnePlus is better than Google's own launcher because you can do more customizations like remove Google search bar (I don't use it) or remove stock widget from home screen (you can't do this on Pixel phones unless you will use different launcher) or do more customizations in terms of adding different icons or changing colors. OnePlus also uses stock Google dialer and messages apps, they are much better than Samsung's apps because they filter spam much better and Google's dialer has integrated visual voicemail (this feature depends on your provider, it works on Verizon but might not work with some other provider) and Google's messages app has support for RCS messaging which you can enable even if your carrier does not want to. You can also customize features such as adding black bar on top of display to hide front camera, something that Samsung used to allow but then they disabled this feature in One UI 3. The OnePlus launcher also looks better from visual point of view compared to Samsung's One UI - Samsung really overdid ""rounded corners"" on every pop-up message box and every menu in their phones, I really dislike it. OnePlus launcher has much less pronounced ""rounded corners"" in menus and message boxes which look better and hopefully something that OnePlus will never change.<br><br>- The fingerprint reader works good for me, much more reliable than what I have seen on Samsung phones with their under display fingerprint readers. Just be aware that third-party screen protectors may interfere with it.<br><br>- The cameras produce good photo quality, especially after latest updates. Initially the photo quality was pretty poor as you can see from all old reviews, but OnePlus has released many updates which increased the photo quality to good levels. It's still not as good as on Pixel phones but very close and with more updates will probably get even better.<br><br>- The battery life is good after all recent updates. Both the standby and use time with display on are pretty good and better than similar models from Samsung. This will probably get even better with more updates by OnePlus.<br><br>Not so good parts:<br><br>- The phone is pretty expensive, especially without good trade-in programs. You can find Galaxy S21+ for cheaper price, especially with great trade-in program that Samsung offers.<br><br>- The phone still has some software bugs which are not fixed, such as bugs with bluetooth which affects some people or bugs with automatic brightness adjustment. All of those will probably fixed with future updates but the phone should not have been released with those bugs.<br><br>- The phone has SnapDragon 888 processor, it is known for high power consumption which creates high heat output. It affected many phones including phones from Samsung and also affected this model. The manufacturers are still trying to adjust this processor's power consumption in their phones, Samsung already does it well but OnePlus has not reached their level yet. You may still see overheat warnings on this model if you live in a warm climate and do things like filming 4k video at high fps. I personally hasn't experienced it but you may find other examples of it. This is something you need to be aware of before buying it."
5,Stellar phone!  DOES NOT WORK ON SPRINT!,"This is a fabulous phone, and why it gets 5 stars.  Scren is great.  Fingerprint and face unlock is great.  Super fast on 5G.  I'm very happy now that I have gotten it to work.<br><br>But a couple of warnings:<br><br>If you are a Sprint customer who thinks you are a T-Mobile customer, you are NOT!  You are still on the Sprint telecommunications network, even though you are able to also use the T-Mobile towers.  This phone, no matter what you do, WILL NOT ACTIVATE on the Sprint network.  Not even in any kind compatibility mode.  Sprint's activation and registration software and systems identifies this phone as a FOREIGN device and there is NO WAY to activate the IMEI number range this phone has been assigned on the Sprint network.  Don't waste your time trying!  I tried 3 different ways.  Not happening!<br><br>The only way I could get the phone to activate was to open up a T-Mobile account and transfer my number over.  If you are a single phone line Sprint customer and do not have any balance owed on your<br>phone, this is an easy thing to do.  And you should do it.  The phone activates instantly on the T-Mobile network.<br><br>But if you have any balance on your Sprint account for any of your active lines, you will need to pay all of those balances off to zero them before you can move over to T-Mobile.  Again, another wonderful side affect of the Sprint and T-Mobile accounting systems not yet being compatible.<br><br>Again, if you have been a Sprint customer, you are not yet a T-Mobile customer.  Not until you have switched your account.  At this point, this has to be done by you.  And can not be done if you still have outstanding balances (lease, payments) for your phone on Sprint.  T-Mobile is not doing this automatically yet.  The Sprint phone support I talked to said that there may be some work starting offering deals to get Sprint customers converted over the holidays.  So look for that.<br><br>Lastly, two days after I bought the phone, Amazon lowered the price by $100.  I chatted with the Amazon Customer support team to see if I could get a refund of the difference in prices.  Again, NOT HAPPENING!  It's not in Amazon's customer service policy to refund differences in prices for your purchases when they happen in just a 2 day period.  I could understand a longer duration, like 5 or more days.  But TWO DAYS?  Really?  I have had experience with a large number of brick-and-mortor retailers that would happily refund the difference in purchase price when an items prices are reduced shortly after purchase.  So, be warned that Amazon does not have a customer service policy like this and seems to not have any way to offer a customer pleasing exemption.<br><br>I guess I could take some comfort in the idea that my non-refunded $100 could go towards more rocket fuel for Jeff Bazos' next trip into space."
3,Not what I was hoping for but it's ok.,"As a long time fan of the OnePlus brand and owner of the OP 1, 3, 6, 7 pro and now 9 Pro, I find this model to be wanting and somewhat unimpressive. I've been using this for over 2 months and here is my review especially when compared to the OP 6 and 7 pro.<br><br>Design - nice finish, smooth and a bit slippery but I have it in a case now. It's a lot heavier and bulkier than I expected.<br><br>Display - excellent<br><br>Sound: Speakers - very loud, crystal clear and impressive quality and surround sound.<br>Sound: Earbuds (wired and wireless) - not as good as the OP6 possibly due to the usb-c and wireless (I use sony wired and wireless headsets).<br><br>Camera - The Hasselblad is excellent quality for near and far images. Excellent photo and video quality.<br><br>Gaming: very fast and smooth with no visual lag<br><br>Battery life: less than I expected as I get the same from my OP6 and 7. I was expecting a lot more hours as I have even less apps installed.<br><br>Dual sim: disappointing. I ordered the US version as I'm in NY an all previous models were dual sim however this US version does not have dual sim. While I understand this to be more due to regulation and not the fault of OP, I think this should be explicitly stated in the title as I now have to use 2 phones and will be giving up this one for the 10 pro this week.<br><br>Overall performace: good. Phone is fast but not much faster than the OP6 with less cores, RAM and storage.<br><br>OS: it's ok but nothing to really stand out. The OS and feel are exactly the same as the older models. No exclusive apps but I guess that lessens the bloatware.<br><br>Call clarity: very good<br><br>Overall Pros - display, sound (only via built-in speakers), amazing camera.<br><br>Overall Cons - bulky, heavy, no dual-sim and less than impressive audio and volume using wired and wireless headsets.<br><br>I've purchased the OP 10 Pro and will give an opinion compared to the OP6 and OP 9 Pro. Cheers."
3,Not what I ordered,"I ordered this phone expecting it to be the LE2125 model, as listed in the description.  What I received was a model number LE2127.  The LE2125 is the factory unlocked model while the LE 2125 is a T-Mobile phone that was unlocked.  First of all, the LE2127 has the T-Mobile bloatware and the T-Mobile boot animation but more importantly, they have different 5G bands and capabilities.  This is shown in the attached image.  The LE2125 is on the left and it supports 9 of the 10 5G bands.  The LE2127 is on the right and it only supports 7 of the 10 5G bands.  (The image shows 17 supported bands for the LE2125 and 8 for the LE2127 but I think the difference is due to bands not available in the US, but I'm not sure).  I wanted the OnePlus 9 Pro with the greatest 5G band compatibility, which is the LE2125, but that is not what I received.<br>On the plus side, the phone is in very nice condition for a refurbished phone and seems to be working as intended.  I'll update this if I notice any other issues."
2,"I chose this phone because it has a physical ""ring-vibrate-silent"" switch - but it doesn't work!","I am frequently in places where I don't want the phone to ring and the physical slide switch on the side of this phone was what convinced me to buy this particular phone.  However, the switch does not work - any alarm I have set will cause the phone to sound the audible alarm even when the phone is set to ""silent mode"".  When I set the switch to silent, the phone screen confirms that it is on silent mode, but the alarms still sound.<br><br>Even if I POWER DOWN the phone, the phone will turn on by itself and sound the alarm tone when the time for the alarm occurs.  Obviously there is no way to actually turn this phone off.  If I could remove the battery I would but that's not practical every time I go into a doctor's office.<br><br>I have been in contact with tech support and they have not been able to correct this major defect.  In fact, both of the times they made suggestions regarding what to do, their instructions for what to change in my settings do not apply to my phone.  They tell me what screen to go into and what setting to change, but that setting does not exist on my phone.<br><br>So, zero stars for OnePlus tech support."
5,Found my Nexus replacement,"Have you ever fallen in love with something only to see the manufacturer discontinue it.  (If you are a Google user then - yes, you would know:-).<br> I was a huge fan of the Nexus phones from Google and it broke my heart when they discontinued the series in favor oF the pixels.  I've been in search of a replacement ever since having tried Samsung, LG and even a Pixel3xl.  The Pixel was nice in the beginning  but endless updates from Google made the phone so unstable that I started looking around again.<br>This One+ 9 Pro is finally the phone I was looking for. Sleek, great screen, fast and once in a proper case, very comfortable to handle (without case it is too slick for me).<br>I got the wireless warp charger for it (~$35) and boy... it charges the phone from 15% to 100% in 20 minutes.  I've never seen anything like that.  The battery lasts me 2 days and I do use it a lot, albeit, probably not as much as the younger generation. The cameras are awesome.  Great quality pictures and videos (without jerking).<br>The only thing that I wonder about is the update frequency of the OS.  It's been almost 6 months since Android 12 was released and the manufacturer is still only on 11.  I'd like to think that they do more testing than Google to avoid the problems that caused me to loose faith in the Pixel3XL in the first place.<br>My phone is a version LE2125 (unlocked on Verizon).  Transferring my data from the old phone was a breeze via Bluetooth.<br>(Edit: just a few days later, the android 12 update came down)"
3,"Don't be me, save yourself a ton of struggle","Don't buy this from a third party seller, if you are looking for a ton of headache go for it...<br><br>I bought this phone from the micarte (I think that's how you spell it) seller and it was labeled north American version. It was not, not even a little bit was it the American version of the one plus 9 pro..<br><br>The one plus 9 pro (us spec) only had one sim. I had to run the model number through countless Google searches and three different cell carries before I got the phone to work, and work is a loose word. I have no service in places my one plus 6 did, I love the phone but the experience was and still is a disaster.<br><br>The display is wonderful, it's snappy, and takes amazing pictures, it charges super fast, and self optimizes charging durning the night it's actually an amazing phone. Just watch out on third party sellers."
5,"Solid choice, just missing past options that made great phones years back.","The build quality is solid, and premium feeling in the hand. It has some weight to it, but is still less than say an iPad Mini.<br><br>Performance wise, I have been able to play some Guitar Hero 3 for Wii (using the right adapters of course) in Dolphin - surprisingly solid performance and now capable of jamming while on the road. Standard mobile games and most applications will not stretch the specs on this one, but emulators definitely will. I have paired this with an amazingly thin case and the Razer Kishi controller for the ultimate emulation and streaming beast on the go.<br><br>My choice came down to price, as I was originally going to go with the Sony Xperia 1 III. That choice also lost me some options in the process such as the awesome 3.5mm jack and DAC combo, and the micro SD slot (I have multiple ranging from 128GB to 1TB for storage away from my server (away from civilization)). Sony is the only top end option for those points but at nearly double the price that I bought the OnePlus 9 Pro at. 256GB of storage will be a little thin for my uses but I can manage.<br><br>TL;DR - for the price, this is the best top-end phone of 2021. Emulation, photography, and overall performance and longevity make this one hard to beat."
3,Battery life is deal killer. Charges insanely fast.,"Several gripes: The battery life is poor.  Barely gets through the day.  It charges insanely fast, but still, the battery life is a serious disappointment.<br><br>Another gripe is when the phone updates, it messes up the screen / app layout.  Just when you get everything laid out nice...<br><br>Camera and video is very good.<br><br>In summary, battery life is a deal killer.  The phone itself is overkill to a large degree factoring in the price.  I think there are other less expensive phones just as good from a practical perspective, like one of the Google pixel phones. I bought one for my son when I got this, and his is thinner smaller, better battery."
3,battery life,"Not bad! Already have problem when I first day turn on the device. The battery went down so fast so I have to reset the phone, but after I reset the phone it goes well."
5,I kinda love this phone.,"I spent way too much time comparing phones, Samsung S22, iPhone 13 etc. Even compared to other Oneplus models. The One plus 9pro had the best specs or close to best on all the things I care about. The gaming mode kicks in seamlessly, haven't really challenged the camera yet but pleased so far. Streaming on Hulu etc is good and the sound quality and volume is excellent. Rather watch on here than my gaming laptop or smart TV."
5,Check your version of you bought here!,They are selling Chinese versions as US versions! Check your RAM you should have 12gb that is US version. If you only have 8gb you have a Chinese version which will work with most carriers in US so it can fool a person. The US version should work with all carriers so if your having issue with it working and can't figure out you prob have Chinese. ..ALSO if you use the Alexa app or smart devices connected to Alexa DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE either version. One plus did an update that now Alexa app will not open just freezes and crashes. Been this way for 2 months now. Amazon rep tried to figure it out with me for about an hour. I've tried numerous different things including factory dam reset and nothing. It's an update one plus did it's a problem talked about on there forums by phone owners and one plus will not acknowledge it.
1,Absolute junk for the price,"**This review has been deleted by amazon or oneplus 5 times.**<br><br>This is a complete bait and switch. The device is sold with Oxygen OS (android 11), but a recent update delivered as a ""standard security update"" completely wipes the device, changing the OS to ColorOS (which is inferior and lacks features that Oxygen has).  The user is given zero warning  about this update, and it is sold as simply moving the android security update to the 03/2022 release.  It is infact a complete OS change.<br><br>Features you lose:<br>1.  Ability to remove some oneplus' bloatware<br>2.  Ability to rename applications/disable<br>3.  Paid apps fail to launch in the new Android 12 ""color os"" (These are up-to-date apps certified to work with Android 12 that fail in OnePlus's junk ColorOS, which is the cannibalized OS used in their Chinese products (brought in when they were purchased/merged with Oppo)<br>4.  The OS lacks substantial features present in in the version this product is sold with. Headphones, camera, and bluetooth audio all failed with legitimate (and previously working) apps.<br>5.  The OTA (over the air) update that changed Oxygen to ColorOS also deleted several personal files (desktop wallpaper, and files in the root of the phone outside standard directories).<br>6.  Battery life is worse after the update as well.  It was already pretty terrible (see other reviews here).  This device drinks power and will require multiple recharges a day if you use the high resolution display / high refresh rate.<br><br>This is relevant to Amazon purchasers, because you will be sold a device that appears/functions one way, and then magically overnight, an update will cripple the device.  You can revert the update, but it is not trivial (a factory reset will not save you)<br><br>Amazon will likely delete this review again, even though I am a verified purchaser.  The critique of this phone is fair and honest. If OnePlus cared about its customers, it would address the egregious trust violations in their system update (and acknowledge the horrible battery life of the device).  Instead, Amazon and OnePlus will likely simply continue to delete my review."
3,Not a dual SIM,"The phone works fine, however I left in the box several months before using and at that time realized when I needed it is only takes 1 SIM and I needed the phone for travel and 2 SIM cards, so unfortunately the phone does not work for the purpose it was purchased for dual SIM card.  On the Amazon site clearly states dual SIM.  Phone works fine, just does not allow 2 SIM cards.<br><br>most people probably fine but for travel i needed dual SIM."
5,Easy excellent android,"Replaced a Google pixel 6 (tons of connectivity problems) with this OnePlus 9 pro, and hallelujah this android actually works! Speed, good layout, pretty good camera, reliablility, all make it a winner. For some reason I don't understand the battery drains quickly. But the lightening charger that is included recharges incredibly quickly too. So far everything works perfectly."
3,No option for 'cellular preferred' calling,Wi-Fi has to be turned off to make calls and then turned back on to use the internet. All day...
3,good phone and great charger,The phone has worked just as expected. works super fast. charges fast when plugged into the box charger. the only issue is the charging box went out after only 2 months and already needs replaced which is disappointing but at least it wasn't the phone.
4,Android 12 has bugs,"Super fast connections, long battery life, awesome camera &amp; the fastest charge I've ever seen."
5,Perfect condition,Perfect condition without the pretty Oneplus box.<br>Upgraded from a Oneplus 8 Pro.<br>Works perfectly.
5,I got the US version,"I was concerned about the reviews saying they were sent the Chinese version with ColorOS and only 8GB of RAM.  But I really needed a new phone ASAP after destroying my OnePlus 7 pro.<br><br>I'm happy to say that I got my 9 pro less than 24 hours after ordering it and it's definitely the US version.  It's a nice phone, super-fast and very familiar after the 7 pro.<br><br>I had no problem unlocking the bootloader and rooting it.  Everything works great."
5,Extremely happy with my purchase,The quality of the product is on point. I think they should charge more to be honest.
5,great phone,"great phone, the 65 watt charger is awesome and fast"
5,"9 pro, great phone","Bought for my wife, she loves the phone.  Not sure about the difference in the chip vs the gen 1, but the 9 pro received great reviews and the price better than the 10 pro.  Now the 10 comes with the 256/12gb, took too long.  I think the 9 pro is all gone now, but glad I got it for my wife."
4,Still some issues on AT&amp;T. Great camera.,"After a couple of days I'm happy with the phone.  It was not on AT&amp;T's list of compatible devices, so I had to make a long phone call so they could do a workaround for this unlocked device to get it working on their network.<br>So plan on making a phone call if you are on AT&amp;T.<br>I did have it give me an overheating warning for a few minutes when I had a few apps open. That quickly cleared up though.<br>I went hiking the other night and loved the photos it produced. The zoom lens is cool."
3,"Good smart phone, can be much better.","Good smart phone, can be much better but it is too quirky compared to others like Samsung or even Huawei before the US ban.  As an example, the location of the volume and power buttons is such that I constantly take unexpected screen shots.  Solid fingerprint, face recognition is fine, camera is good but not as good as others specially with the Hasselblad partnership. For the price is a solid SP that can be much better."
4,Works as advertised,"Charges extremely fast only problem was when I put protective shield on the screen the screen became less responsive, but that may have been because of the hard cover"
3,Single Sim and not Dual Sim,"Hello,<br>The description shows it as Dual Sim device.<br>I received a single sim. very disappointed.<br>Realized a month or so after delivery<br>If you need dual Sim get the Uk/International version also vendor should change the product details as this caused an expensive purchase and inconvenience"
5,Espectacular,Chavaaaal flipo
4,Buggy but I like it,"So, the phone is a good phone in most cases. However my phone has alot of issues. When watching YouTube the video shudders. Also when using Android auto, my phone wont connect 75% of the time. I know it's not the head unit Because it worked with all my other phones. The device also gets hot when charging. Other than that this phone is pretty good."
5,"Great smartphone, I'm just in love with it!","Great product. I've always been Samsung fan, but this is so much better than Samsung! Everything's perfect. The battery goes down a little fast, but I don't really care about it, because it charges very fast, literally few minutes. Loved it!"
5,Battery works great now.,"My first review has changed because after an update that the phone received, the battery actually last way longer now.  I was also about to return this phone but kept it and I am happy with how it works.  One thing that does get old is that the sensor detects if you have you hand over the screen, which I have to switch hands sometimes and it covers my viewing area.  The other is that the camera does launch on its own every now and then.  So far, I'm very happy after the update."
4,Es un buen teléfono,Me encanta el teléfono el único problema es que su batería se termina muy pronto pero es tan funcionable y practico
3,Performance is not as expected,"Similar to other reviews posted here, I find the phone to be slower than expected. From camera launches, to opening your gallery or closing and opening apps. It's just not smooth.<br><br>Best feature about this phone is the warp charge which takes you from near dead to 50% in 15 mins. Think OnePlus has strayed too far from their mission of making supposed flagship killers but not at flagship price. This is clearly flagship price but does not deliver that competition to an iPhone"
3,Sad,"Had OnePlus 5, works fantastic. I love the 9, but, there are too many problems. Fingerprint reader barely works, camera sometimes works sometimes crashes. Hole punch camera proven unnecessary with OnePlus 7 pro, glitchy sometimes it freezes when I'm doing simple tasks like browsing the web. I'm just sad, I really wanted to love this phone, but, biggest issue is camera stops working as soon as the phone updates. I guess if I'm going to hate my phone I might as well switch to an iPhone, at least it works."
5,ideal for special ed son,"Phone met the special requirements of my special ed son. Long battery life, wireless operation and charging, and large memory. Can be used/played with most of the day and still have power needed for emergencies, and can be charged in an hour in case you forgot.<br>I purchased a Oneplus 8T for myself a year ago and have been very satisfied with it."
5,Huge memory. And it is way cheaper than competition,I love the fact that with this phone I get all the great features that all the drastically more expensive phones have.
1,False Advertisement,"The whole point of getting this phone specifically was to put lineageOS or iodeOS on it. This requires an unlocked phone - including the bootloader. The T-Mobile version of this phone (LE2127) is not compatible and does NOT have an unlockable bootloader. Despite amazon clearly listing LE2125 (a fully compatible model) here, what I received is marked as a LE2127."
5,Oneplus always a good purchase,"I've had multiple OnePlus phones and they are my favorite. Lots of ram, processing power. Android is made for more advanced users, if you aren't, stick with iCrap."
3,I’m not the smartest but software gore,"My apps disappeared when I put them on Home Screen so I have to go to drawer to open them and YouTube sometimes unpauses on its own. Runs most apps, games and ROMs at a high quality other than that the phone ran pretty well"
1,"Que el articulo sea, exactamente como dice la descripcion del mismo.","En la descripcion del articulo dice, "" DESBLOQUEADO "", y cuando empiezo a configurarlo, no me registra la red, y me sale bloqueado por la compañia T-mobile. No es agradable jugar con las personas, devieron haber notificado que el celular estaba reportado oh bloqueado."
3,meh battery life,"other than battery life, it is pretty good. however i eventually return it, the battery can barely last one day of light use, even if i turn on battery saving mode and reduce screen resolution and refresh rate"
1,The absolute worst phone I've ever owned,"I will never, ever even consider buying another one of these garbage can phones ever again. In 6 months it has proven to be the worst phone I've owned in almost 20 years of owning cell phones. And realistically, the hardware is fine, it's the garbage can operating system that truly raises the bar on awfulness. The very first system update from about 5 or 6 months ago rendered the phone unable to connect to any network so I had to factory reset the phone and restore everything from backup, so it was a complete waste of time. After that I've been avoiding any repeat of a system update because I shudder to imagine whatever deleterious effect it will have now. And then today it decided to spontaneously restart and I lost network connections yet again, although the system has not been updated. I can't recommend staying away from this useless garbage enough. I've already told my friends and family to stay away from and avoid One+ like the plague. Now excuse me while I go get a new phone."
1,NOT the US model. Not 12G of Ram. Not a 5G phone!,To start the phone is an 8 GB of RAM not the advertised 12 GB of RAM. The phone was dropping calls like crazy and the phone was not receiving a lot of calls. I took the phone to T-Mobile and I was told that it wasn't a 5G phone. 5G wasn't even an option on the settings of the phone. I did a Google search on the model number and found that that model number is a global model number. Is not the USA version of this phone. False advertising! I had the One Plus 7 Pro and I bought it directly from the OnePlus website. No issues with that one. I cannot recommend anybody in the USA to buy this thing from Amazon.
4,One+9 Pro Does as Advertised but Short on Battery,Great phone but the battery limits streaming
2,"Withholding recommadation to my friends, or anyone.","Hugh negative surprise yesterday (03/24/2022). After a push-down system update, my phone can not make or receive calls. My OP 9 Pro can not connect to my cellular service provider's network after update. For all the functions that should be working, the very basic one for a telephone, receiving and making calls, is not. Seems there is no customer/tech service at all. Left a message on OnePlus's Facebook message board, like a stone sank in a river. Called a number displayed on the company's website, same thing. What a disappointment."
1,But a Samsung S22 instead!!,I bought two of these for my Wife and myself. My Wife's phone will not down load  and open attachments in txts and email while mine will. Can't seem to resolve this. Both phones were a pain in the ass to get to work on Consumers Cellular ATT). I wasted hours with tech support.<br>Wish I had of spent the extra $$ and bought Samsung S22's instead. I also use my phone for work so this has been even more of an inconvenience. Go with Samsung. Avoid all OnePlus product!! Now I have take a huge loss to upgrade to the S22 plus because the OnePlus 9 is no longer worth much used. Hope I can save others the headaches.
3,Everything OK except camera,"I liked this Phone, everything is perfect except camera, i did not like picture and video quality, my old iPhone 11 pro max had much much better camera quality and that's why I returned it."
1,A used phone with damage from drop and T-mobile logo,"Nowhere on the description of the item says it is a used item / renewed. I purchased and expect a new in box phone. Instead it has no original package, damages on the bottom corners, and when you start, a T-Mobile logo pops up - T Mobile is also not mentioned anywhere in the description. This is very disappointing."
2,"Good performance, descent battery, horrible updates",Performance is great and battery descent. Charging is awesome either wirelessly or connected... Full charge in less than 30min.<br><br>Issues are mostly with the new Hydrogen OS12 that's pretty buggy and isn't getting any better after several months.<br><br>Also Android Auto implementation doesn't seem to work on all vehicles.<br>Cameras are much better than my oneplus 8 pro.<br><br>That being said for the price (with discount) it can't really be beat and still better than Samsung imo
3,A little disappointed,"It is a good phone but it is a single chip, and it does not bring you the case, and it gives many problems with the internet, many times the internet stops working for long periods of time"
1,DO NOT BUY USED,"Do not buy used, especially from ""Mercati."" I purchased this phone and it would not read my SIM card. I took it to T-Mobile and bought a new SIM card to try even though my SIM card worked in my OnePlus 8 Pro. The worker and manager both thought the internal antenna was probably non-functional. Sent phone back and had to wait for my refund. Seller kept $100 ""re-stock fee"" that was not mentioned anywhere. Now I have to go through Amazon to try to get my full refund. I would have been happy to keep the phone if it had worked! Now I'm out time and money."
5,Alguien me ayuda,Todo excelente solo k yo ordené la versión de 12gb ram y 256gb almacenamiento y me llegó pero con 8gb de ram y 256 GB no entiendo nada...alguien sabe porqué?
1,no longer a good brand,"This model and all the following ones have problems with Android Auto. Multiples threads on support forums about this issue. OnePluse doesn't care.<br><br>Similar problem with many hi-res USB DACs. No fix, no support."
5,Better than anything else,Best ever
3,Non north American,Verified by one+ tech. These are intended for the Chinese market. Not north America. They will not work on Verizon. Also did not have wireless charging.
2,"Slow, unsupported software.","The company does not care about it's users anymore, my OnePlus 9 pro is very slow, restarts on its own and just full of annoying glitches from time to time, even with full bar 5g service and wifi. They scammed everyone here by selling unfinished products and are already about to release newer phones come January, what a load of crap! Returning and getting a Samsung."
5,Happy,Wish OnePlus would add a cheap plastic case again.
1,Terrible phone that's only gotten worse,"When I first bought the phone, I was initially impressed with how responsive it felt and by how fast it charges. That's about it. The reception isn't the best and it doesn't seem to support wifi calling. This was a 2, maybe 3 star phone at best. With the latest update (updated to Android 12), it decided to reset my notification settings to allow all notifications, YouTube now randomly pauses while watching videos and there no longer appears to be a way to disable the audible notification when you charge your phone. At this point, I'm done with this thing. I'm getting a Samsung Note, like I should have to begin with.<br><br>***Edit***<br>Performed a factory reset in hopes that it would clear up issue. Unfortunately, it has not."
5,"Good phone, the value for money is no longer relevant as it's the same price like Samsung flagship.","The OnePlus 9 Pro is a good phone with a good camera (have to say I expected more on the camera side), fair battery, very strong CPU, and RAM."
5,Amazing buy!!,"This phone is smooth, and easy to use.<br>The warp charging is insanely fast and love the battery life. Fully recommend!"
1,Meh phone wrong listing,"Got this to replace my OP8 and love it however the listing says 12GB of RAM as opposed to the 8GB model I received. It's still a good value but I did get my hopes up a bit on that assumption. Also it came pre-setup with a Chinese account logged in and I had to use my old phone's menus as reference to change it to English so I could use it easier.<br><br>Update (12/04/2021) - The RAM makes all the difference, runs significantly worse and inconsistently than my 12GB OP8 I had. I already gave that as a hand-me-down so I'm stuck with this 8GB OP9Pro. Knocking down to a 1 star until an update fixes RAM usage and the listing is fixed.<br><br>Camera otherwise is great, but the misleading listing is inexcusable."
5,This is a great phone!,Wow! This is a great phone! 5g speed is fast. And the face recognition works with a mask on! Although it is a big phone.
5,Es un producto excelente asta ahora estoy satisfecho lo recomiendo 👍👍,🤝👏
2,Loyal OnePlus Customer-Extremely Disappointed,"Apps lag<br>System lags<br>Constantly having to restart the phone<br>Connection issues I didn't have with 7Pro and I love in a major metro area<br>Sure it charges fast, but the battery drains fast too<br>Camera is just ok, not great<br><br>Will not buy another OnePlus"
3,This model is uni sim not dual sim.,"Unfortunately this phone is a uni sim, not dual sim, 😕"
5,Great phone,Love this ouone
5,One plus 9 pro,Excelente celular me gusto mucho 😄😁
5,"Don't listen to others. Try it for yourself, it's literally free. You won't be disappointed.",Top notch android phone. Price is the only problem. But hey how much does the s21 ultra cost.
2,Worst phone I've bought,"Over heats like crazy, the camera is barely an upgrade from the 8 pro, and the screen is literally the same. Oneplus just isnt what they used to be, if you want to stay android go for pixel or samsung, oneplus just isnt it anymore"
5,Muy bonito y cumple con todo!,Excelente celular recomendado!
1,No es 5 G,"Entré a red móvil y solo tiene 2-3g ni a 4 llega, que decepción."
1,El cable cargador es de mala calidad y el celular vino rayado,"&nbsp;El cable de carga es de pésima calidad, el material es como si se estuviera derritiendo, se dañó uno de los puntos de carga, se peló se abrió totalmente en menos de 12 horas de haberla abierto<br>Pésima calidad y material<br><br>El celular vino rayada la pantalla"
5,Best phone on the market,"I love this phone, worth every penny"
5,Great phone.,Great phone. Face recognition is perfect. Picture quality is superb.
1,Great but DECEPTION,Great but DECEPTION as never advertise it is single sim instead of DUAL...so bad for seller and even worst for OnePlus fabricant. This marks the end of preference for this brand....will return to SAMSUNG.<br>To carry Hasselblad brand on the phone you would also like to have such cameras not just software to tune up any other camera
2,Not Happy.,Camera hardly works always over heating. The thumb reader hardly works reset it 4 times. The bluetooth gives me a hard time. This phone frustrates me big-time. I had the OnePlus 7 pro was a great phone but this one. Meh
1,"Too Hot, Not Recommended",It gets too hot the moment turned on and that is a bad sign that will destroy the whole system. I could not say anything about the features since I can not hold it with my hand
1,Not Worth It!,"Most importantly: COULDN'T ANSWER A CALL<br>Tried EVERY fix mentioned by others with no success in answering a call and I'm proficient with electronics.<br>Battery drain was excessive IMO even after changes to ""improve""<br>Lost features from 6T and 7T - Had been happy with both the 6T and 7T<br>Won't be buying OnePlus again"
1,Issue with Call Merge and Switching to Mobile data from WiFi,"Dislike : Not sure why devices are not tested well. Basic features like Call merge and Move to Mobile data from Mobile data is not happening. This 2 issues I identified and reported to OnePlus and Amazing. However I still did not receive resolution to this issue.<br>Apart from that, this device is getting heated up."
1,Riddled with Spyware - Screen Recorded runs all the time!,"Phone looks good and feels good. But if you want to protect your data, forget about it.  Screen recorder, which starts the camera and QualComm voice runs all the time. Anything you view, type or say into the phone will be captured. SYPWARE for CHINA. Oh yeah...one other thing, this order was a bundle an is to come with wireless charger....good luck ,did not get it an amaZ0n don't want to correct the order...told me to return the phone. Disappointed on both counts."
1,This phone wastes its high specs,"I liked that the phone has high specs, but you wouldn't know it if you used the phone. It's so user unfriendly and poorly optimized that it's actually slower and takes worse photos than my Samsung s7. I'm returning it and using the refund money to buy another Samsung"
1,Screen burn in!,"The screen burn in, is so bad! I'd avoid oneplus from now on."
2,Seal was broken &amp; the clear protective case is missing,Seal was broken &amp; clear protective case is missing.
1,"Was NOT 12GB, was NOT unlocked. Buyers beware!","Tldr: went through Verizon, both IMEIs state locked and unable to be used, systems settings also state 8GB vs 12GB but everything shows it's a OnePlus 9 Pro. Won't ever go for an unlocked phone again."
1,Model Sent Not For US Networks,"When trying to connect to US celluar provider, was informed the IMEI was for foreign networks only. Started with ""8"" for the IMEI."
1,No sirve,"Este teléfono parece que no era el original, la batería se descargaba rápidamente, se le metió agua a la cámara, trate de actualizar software y se demoró una eternidad, calentaba y era súper lento."
1,The product does not match the purchase.,"The delivered product was a one plus 9 pro of 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, but the product I paid for was a one plus 9 pro of 12GB RAM and 256GB storage"
1,Doesn't work,Support wants my new phone for 7-10 days to find out why it doesn't work....<br>Don't buy OnePlus anymore - bad company to do business with.
1,NO TIENE DUAL CHIO ALGO ABSURDO,Es decepcionante que siendo un nivel superior al que tenía (One Plus 7) este venga sin doble chip
1,Phone was Great before they upgraded it to Android 12,After the Android 12 update this phone has so many issues that I'm trying to get rid of this phone.
1,bad,"This kind of mobile phone doesn't work well at all, and it can't be charged frequently."
1,Does not work with Android Auto,Does not connect with Android Auto without needing to perform a raindance of work arounds every time you need to connect.  Unacceptable for a $1k phone.
5,Best phone that I have owned,"The OnePlus 9 Pro is a superb cell phone with everything that one could want. First, it is an excellent phone. Voices of callers are clear and the fidelity os excellent whether listing through the handset, using it as a speakerphone or connecting it to a Bluetooth device. Callers report that hearing me is easy, also with good fidelity. The phone uses three microphones, one on the top, one on the bottom, and one on the back of the phone. In addition to picking up my voice when I am talking, the microphone inputs are collected, and a noise-reduction algorithm is applied. Unlike many carriers, T-Mobile uses its 5G  band for telephony as well as data.<br>The camera and related supporting software is excellent. The phone has four lenses on the back plus a front-facing camera that can be used for selfies. The flexibility of the cameras, the zooming, using of infrared for focusing as well as for shooting in low-light situals.<br>The audio processing is excellent. In addition to the usual file formats for recording and capture, the phone's Bluetooth formats include LDAC.<br>I kept this phone when it was time for an ""upgrade"" because noving to the OnePlus 10 Pro, any of the Samsug phones, or the Apple 14 series would result in the loss of functions and flexibility.<br>zIf the OnePlus 11 Pro is as flexible as the OnePlus 9 Pro and is able to provide the same camera, mujsic processing, Bluetooth formats, and memory, I will switch. If not, I won't."
1,didnt meet the expectations,"Apps keep freezing, battery backup is also a concerning issue"
1,"Son unos ladrones, ofrecen 12 gb de ram y te lo envían de 8 gb","Apps keep freezing, battery backup is also a concerning issue"
1,The worst cellphone I've ever used,the system is not smooth at all.<br>and the screen was broken after 2-day's use.
1,Phone was advertised as used like new. Definitely not the case...,the system is not smooth at all.<br>and the screen was broken after 2-day's use.
1,Worst phone I ever bought.,Magnificent fingerprint reader.
5,As described. Brand New. 12GB RAM / 256GB STORAGE,"Item arrived in brand new condition as described. Working awesome with Android 13 / OxygenOS 13. Just noticed my phone came without case, anyways i use Spigen cases."
3,"From ""Never Settle"" to ""meh""","Been using OP phones since the start. Owned a 1, 2, 5T and now this 9 Pro. GF had the 6 and now the regular 9, a buddy the 7T McLaren. So I've had a fair amount of experience with their product line.<br>It really seems like with each successive release in the last few years every time they are following the market leaders rather than delivering a consistent product. My 5T, minus it's less than stellar camera, was an absolutely amazing device. Still after several years, great battery life, and it has a headphone jack! I know, I know... Yet somehow this 9 Pro is larger than my 5T, doesn't have true stereo speakers, doesn't have crazy internals like a periscope camera... And yet here we are, no headphone jack. Which would be alright, if they included an adapter, which they don't, and they are consistently out of stock on their website.<br>This 9 ""Pro"" has been an exercise in compromises. Coming from the 5t, it's honestly a step back in many ways, with the one notable exception being the amazing camera... Yes OnePlus finally got it right with the camera. Shame that it came at the cost of everything else. Fingerprint reader? Forget it. It's junk. My 5t fingerprint reader was amazing. It was rare that it didn't recognize me. Usually because I had something on my fingers. 9 Pro? Fails more often than it works. Usually have to put my finger on the glass 3-4 times before it will recognize it.<br>It's constantly going into pocket mode. When it's on the table. When it's on the charger. When it's on the car seat. When you haven't touched it in a while. Best part is you usually have to hit the power button 2-3 times before it figures out what's going on. It doesn't stop it from turning on the flashlight though if you barely touch the screen when picking ng it up)<br>Wireless charging is amazingly fast. Like, this is some magic voodoo stuff. Too bad when you put it on the nice wireless charger it often puts itself into ""bedtime mode"" and... stops charging itself for some reason. (A side note, the wireless charger doesn't come with it's own PSU, it's sold separately of course, and is required to make it work at high speed, which would be tolerable except OnePlus NEVER has them available separately, always out of stock.. sensing a pattern here?)<br>Today the phone's microphone wouldn't work. No idea why. Nobody could hear me on calls till I rebooted. Pretty basic stuff eh?<br>Sometimes the phone makes phantom notification sounds. You hear it beep about something but when you pick it up, there's nothing there.<br>I guess the display is nice. I don't game nor do I need to watch 4k 120hz content on a phone so none of the display tech matters to me at all. Honestly my old 5T is easier to see in sunlight. It would be nice if they'd found some way to keep a notification LED on the screen as the customization you could get with that was very useful for app-customized notification lights. Now you only get always-on display. Don't care. Colored notifications lights could let me see from a distance what my phone received. Now I have to pick it up and look at it to tell. A step backwards in usability. Third party apps exist but they kill the battery if you set them up to behave exactly like how the old devices worked.<br>When I first got the device, it had a software bug that Gmail push wouldn't work. So I wasn't getting any email notifications until I opened up the app. They fixed that at least.<br><br>The camera is up to par with what you would expect for a $1000 phone. Everything else about this phone is decidedly midrange. Fingerprint reader is meh at best. Software is inconsistent and more limited than previous OP offerings in customization. Definitely will not be looking to OP next time I am buying myself a premium handset."
